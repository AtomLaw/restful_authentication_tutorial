9/05/08: Alpha release

A more in depth tutorial is located at http://railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?id=14216. Details on the new version of the restful authentication plugin can be found at http://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication/wikis/home.

KNOWN ISSUES
	- View and Layout notes for the rails-footnotes plugin do not work due to changes to ActionView::Base
	- SessionsController#create returns ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken unless protect_from_forgery is skipped for the create action. This may just be an issue on my end from fooling with the cookies, secret, and session key.
	- OpenID plugin returns unknown method relative_url_root even though its defined in ActionController::AbstractRequest. Created an initializer to temporarily fix the problem. http://gist.github.com/6240 
	- Roles controller needs to be redesigned. Currently mass assigns user (shouldn't be a problem because only admins can access the controller) and can return the wrong flash message if the role association is updated but user validations still fail.
	- Not sure if the exception_logger is working properly. If someone can test and let me know if it works or what the problem is it would be greatly appreciated. 

TODO
	- Fix known issues
	- Full rSpec test suite
	- Integrate optional recaptcha helpers
	- Track failed login attempts and display recaptcha
	- Better access and permission denied redirects
	- Make the ActivationsController "activate" action restful
	- Beta invitations
	- Integrate user interface plugins / dry form builders
	- Move query stats and rows logger to footnotes plugin
	- Add css / open source design template (that does not require attribution)
	- Refactoring, google authentication, oauth, api metering
